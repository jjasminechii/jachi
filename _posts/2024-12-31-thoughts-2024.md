title: "a few thoughts on my 2024"

Okay, I lied. I have a lot of thoughts. I'll try to keep it somewhat short, but no promises.

## for a bit of context
I’ve been a teaching assistant since my first quarter as a second-year student at UW, and honestly, 
it’s probably the most consuming (in the best way) thing I’ve been a part of in college so far. 
I’m not going to dive into what TAing has meant to me in this post—those words would probably
take up this post and then some—but I’ll save that for a separate post.

To understand 2024 for me, I’ve got to reflect a bit on the second half of 2023. That summer and fall,
I was deep in prep mode for recruiting season. I spent weeks studying for technical interviews,
putting in the hours, and pushing myself hard. By the end of October, it all paid off—I landed
an offer to work at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) in New York City. I was pretty excited 
to say the least. It was my first internship, and I’ve always wanted to live in NYC.

But at the same time, I was TAing that fall quarter, which I was thoroughly enjoying (as I always do),
but starting to feel a little burnt out. I had this strange mix of excitement and fatigue. 
To be honest, I was looking forward to the end of 2023 and the start of 2024. 
To me, 2024 had all the markers of a fresh start, a chance to reset and dive into something new.

## now, let's start from the beginning
By the time 2024 rolled around, I’d been a TA for five quarters, and I was just going into my sixth.
In a lot of ways, I felt like I had finally figured it out. I had found a rhythm with balancing my
coursework, TAing, and—well, to some degree—my social life. After all, the fall quarter had been
a whirlwind: I was recruiting, juggling two CS classes, waking up at 8am for an English course,
and TAing like there was no tomorrow. It felt like a lot, but somehow, I made it work. I felt
almost like I could handle anything that came my way. So, naturally, I did what any sane
person would do: I added even more to my plate.

I decided to take on the dreaded 8am (because I'm bad at scheduling) linear algebra course 
that I'd been putting off, threw an extra CS education seminar into my schedule, and ramped 
up my TA responsibilities even more. Because why not? If I could handle the chaos of the fall, 
surely I could do it all over again, right? Well, I was mostly right. Until I wasn't.
Towards the end of the winter quarter, I started to feel the burnout creeping in. 
Unfortunately (or fortunately, I’m not sure which), I’m pretty good at ignoring 
how these things make me feel and just pushing through. So, I did. By the skin of my
teeth, I made it through the quarter. But it wasn’t pretty. I probably wouldn't do it 
again if I had the chance.

## grad school, maybe?
Since my second year, I’ve been thinking about grad school—specifically, the 
[Combined Bachelor’s/Master’s (BS/MS) program](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/graduate/bsms/)
UW offers for CS. I’ve thought about it so much that by the end of my third year,
when I should’ve been  writing my essay and getting everything together in the spring, I started 
getting cold feet. Maybe it was the lingering burnout from the winter quarter, or 
maybe I was just starting to feel like I was in a rut. Either way, it took me a while to 
get my act together and start working on my application. And by "start", I 
mean I wrote my essay the day it was due. I know, I know—definitely not
my proudest moment. But hey, I got it done, and it all worked out in the end.

## a nyc summer
For all my excitement about my internship in New York, I was also equal parts nervous. 
But, luckily, those nerves didn’t stick around for long. From the very start,
I had lucked out with an incredible intern cohort (seriously, some amazing friends), a supportive mentor, 
and a team that genuinely made me feel welcome. To say I had an awesome
summer would honestly be an understatement.

I know it sounds cheesy, but I learned so much about myself and what I want in a career
and role. I learned that I love working on a team, that I want to be a part of a fast-paced environment,
and that I want to work on projects that have a real, tangible impact. It wasn’t just about
coding or technical skills; it was about collaboration, communication, and finding a sense
of purpose in the work I’m doing. 

I also realized that I’m not entirely sold on New York City. Don’t get me wrong—it’s an
amazing place, but I’m not sure it’s the perfect fit for me.
Maybe it’s the constant noise, or perhaps the fact that living in such a huge city, 
especially on my own at first, felt a bit isolating, but I’m still working through
those feelings and figuring out how I fit into it all.

## the start of senior year and recruiting, again
Coming back to Seattle for my senior year was a bit of a shock. After getting so used to 
the constant buzz of New York City, Seattle’s quiet almost felt eerie. But at the same time,
I was excited to be back—hang out with my friends, dive into my last year of college. 
I took it easy for fall quarter, focusing just on TAing and two classes. It was a nice
change of pace, honestly. I finally felt like I could breathe again. I had time to think,
to reflect, to just be. I also got more time to read more books, which was a very welcome bonus.

I spent a while deciding whether to recruit again or stick with my original plan to apply
to teach at UW for the summer of 2025. I went back and forth for weeks, weighing the pros
and cons of each option. At first, it felt like a tough choice, but in the end, I decided to
go for another internship. It was a bit of a different path from what I had planned, but it felt like 
the right move. After my summer at Palantir, I realized there was still so much I wanted to 
learn. This felt like the perfect opportunity to push myself even further—step outside 
my comfort zone and see what’s out there.

Because I couldn’t decide for so long, I ended up starting my internship search a bit later 
than I wanted. But, looking back, I’m kind of glad it worked out that way. Having gone 
through the process once before, I felt a lot more prepared this time around. It didn’t
feel as daunting, even though I had a smaller window of time. After a few months and 
a few (stressful) rounds of interviews with different companies, I accepted an offer to intern at 
[Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com) in Los Gatos, California, working on ads. This time around, 
I’ll be working on a team that’s more focused on the backend side of things (a shift from last
summer when I was working more on frontend), which I’m really excited about.

## wrapping up
Looking back on 2024, it’s hard not to feel a bit surprised by how much has happened.
I’ve learned a lot—about my work, about myself, and about what I really want. 
Between TAing, my internship at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/), and even figuring
out the grad school decision at the last minute, it’s been a year of navigating
uncertainty and being more comfortable with feeling uncomfortable. I’m grateful
for all of it. Even the slight burnout, even the moments of doubt, because I think 
that's where the real growth happened.

There’s still so much I’m figuring out, especially about what I want long-term—whether
that’s where I end up living, what projects I want to work on, or how I’ll balance
my career with everything else. But for now, I’m taking it one step at a time. 
Senior year is already flying by, and there’s still a lot ahead. What I do know is
that I’m more excited than ever about the future, and somehow, I think I’ll end up
where I’m meant to be.

Here’s to 2025. Let’s see what it has in store.
